// stack(Primitive) and heap(Non-Primitive )

// In JavaScript, primitive data types (like String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt)
// are stored in the stack memory. When you assign a primitive value to a variable, the value itself is stored.

// Non-primitive data types (like Objects, Arrays, Functions, Dates, RegExps) are stored in the heap memory.
// When you assign a non-primitive value to a variable, the variable stores a reference (address) to the location in the heap
// where the actual data is stored.

// Example:
let a = 10; // 'a' holds the value 10 directly (stack)
let b = a;  // 'b' gets a copy of the value 10 (separate from 'a')
b = 20;     // changing 'b' does not affect 'a'

let obj1 = { name: "Kritika" }; // 'obj1' holds a reference to the object in heap
let obj2 = obj1;                // 'obj2' gets the same reference as 'obj1'
obj2.name = "Jain";             // changing 'obj2' also changes 'obj1' (since both point to the same object)
console.log(obj1.name);         // Output:
